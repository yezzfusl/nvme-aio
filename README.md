# NVMe Adaptive I/O Scheduler

This kernel module implements an intelligent I/O scheduler optimized for modern NVMe SSDs. It uses machine learning techniques to predict I/O patterns, dynamically adjust queue depths, and manage wear leveling.

## Features (TODO)

- Machine learning-based I/O pattern prediction
- Dynamic queue depth adjustment
- Adaptive wear-leveling strategies
- Support for various NVMe SSD architectures

## Building and Installing

To build the module:

`make`

To install the module:

`sudo insmod nvme_adaptive_io.ko`

To remove the module:

`sudo rmmod nvme_adaptive_io`
